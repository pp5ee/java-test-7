Your work is not finished. Read and execute the below with ultrathink.


**Delegation Warning**: Do NOT implement code yourself in Agent Teams mode; delegate all coding tasks to team members.

## Original Implementation Plan

**IMPORTANT**: Before proceeding, review the original plan you are implementing:
@docs/plan.md

This plan contains the full scope of work and requirements. Ensure your work aligns with this plan.

---

For all tasks that need to be completed, please use the Task system (TaskCreate, TaskUpdate, TaskList) to track each item in order of importance.
You are strictly prohibited from only addressing the most important issues - you MUST create Tasks for ALL discovered issues and attempt to resolve each one.

Before executing each task in this round:
1. Read @/app/workspaces/d2ec6a65-6577-4333-93c3-5190dc25b4f3/.humanize/bitlesson.md
2. Run `bitlesson-selector` for each task/sub-task
3. Follow selected lesson IDs (or `NONE`) during implementation

Below is Codex's review result:
<!-- CODEX's REVIEW RESULT START -->
# Code Review - Round 0

## Summary

I've reviewed the implementation against the original plan and verified the following:

### Verified Implementations

1. **Email Service with SMTP**: Implemented in `EmailService.java` with:
   - Redis-based verification code storage with TTL
   - Rate limiting (1 code per minute)
   - Async email sending via JavaMailSender
   - Configurable SMTP settings in application.yml

2. **Admin User Removal**: Implemented in `UserService.deleteUser()`:
   - Only admins can remove users
   - Soft delete with `deleted`, `deletedAt`, `deletedBy` fields
   - Prevents self-deletion

3. **Role-Based Task Assignment**: Basic implementation exists:
   - Task creator is set from SecurityUtils.getCurrentUser()
   - Only creator or admin can reassign tasks

4. **Frontend-Backend Integration**: Verified API endpoints match:
   - `taskService.getKanban()` → GET `/tasks/kanban` ✓
   - All service methods align with controller endpoints

### Fix Applied
- Corrected `TaskServiceTest.java` - the `createTask()` method signature only takes `CreateTaskRequest`, not `userId`

### Goal Alignment Check
```
ACs: 3/3 addressed | Forgotten items: 0 | Unjustified deferrals: 0
```

All acceptance criteria from the original plan are addressed:
- AC-1: All features implemented (auth, roles, task board, frontend)
- AC-2: Test suite written (tests need Java/Maven to run)
- AC-3: README.md created

## Remaining Items
- Run unit tests when Java/Maven environment available
- Integration testing with real MySQL/Redis/SMTP

VERDICT: INCOMPLETE - Tests cannot be verified in current environment, but implementation appears complete.

## Goal Tracker Reference (READ-ONLY after Round 0)

Before starting work, **read** @/app/workspaces/d2ec6a65-6577-4333-93c3-5190dc25b4f3/.humanize/rlcr/2026-04-16_06-31-59/goal-tracker.md to understand:
- The Ultimate Goal and Acceptance Criteria you're working toward
- Which tasks are Active, Completed, or Deferred
- Any Plan Evolution that has occurred
- Open Issues that need attention

**IMPORTANT**: You CANNOT directly modify goal-tracker.md after Round 0.
If you need to update the Goal Tracker, include a "Goal Tracker Update Request" section in your summary (see below).

---

Note: You MUST NOT try to exit by lying, editing loop state files, or executing `cancel-rlcr-loop`.

After completing the work, please:
0. If the `code-simplifier` plugin is installed, use it to review and optimize your code. Invoke via: `/code-simplifier`, `@agent-code-simplifier`, or `@code-simplifier:code-simplifier (agent)`
1. Commit your changes with a descriptive commit message
2. Write your work summary into @/app/workspaces/d2ec6a65-6577-4333-93c3-5190dc25b4f3/.humanize/rlcr/2026-04-16_06-31-59/round-1-summary.md

## Task Tag Routing Reminder

Follow the plan's per-task routing tags strictly:
- `coding` task -> Claude executes directly
- `analyze` task -> execute via `/humanize:ask-codex`, then integrate the result
- Keep Goal Tracker Active Tasks columns `Tag` and `Owner` aligned with execution

Note: Since `--push-every-round` is enabled, you must push your commits to remote after each round.

**If Goal Tracker needs updates**, include this section in your summary:
```markdown
## Goal Tracker Update Request

### Requested Changes:
- [E.g., "Mark Task X as completed with evidence: tests pass"]
- [E.g., "Add to Open Issues: discovered Y needs addressing"]
- [E.g., "Plan Evolution: changed approach from A to B because..."]
- [E.g., "Defer Task Z because... (impact on AC: none/minimal)"]

### Justification:
[Explain why these changes are needed and how they serve the Ultimate Goal]
```

Codex will review your request and update the Goal Tracker if justified.

## Agent Teams Continuation

Continue using **Agent Teams mode** as the **Team Leader** within the RLCR development cycle. You are continuing from a previous round where Codex reviewed your work and provided feedback above.

### Continuation Context

- **Previous Team No Longer Exists**: Your teammates from the previous round are gone. Do NOT attempt to message or reference old teammates. You must create a brand new team for this round.
- **Review First**: Before spawning any team members, carefully analyze the Codex review feedback above. Understand which issues are most critical and plan your team allocation accordingly.
- **Do Not Redo Work**: Review what was accomplished in previous rounds (check the goal tracker and prior summaries). Only address the issues and gaps identified in the review - do not redo work that was already completed correctly.
- **Cold Start for New Members**: Each new team member has NO context from previous rounds and NO access to your conversation history. They DO have access to CLAUDE.md and project configuration automatically. When spawning members, provide: what was already accomplished in previous rounds, the current state of relevant files, specific review findings they need to address, and clear acceptance criteria. Do not repeat what CLAUDE.md already covers.
- **Multi-Iteration Awareness**: If the remaining work exceeds what a single team can accomplish in this round, prioritize the most critical items from the review. Address high-priority issues first so subsequent rounds have less to fix.
- **State Awareness**: Previous rounds may have left partial changes or introduced new patterns. Verify the current state of files (e.g., with quick reads or greps) before assigning file ownership to team members.

### Your Role

You are the team leader. Your ONLY job is coordination and delegation. You must NEVER write code, edit files, or implement anything yourself.

Your primary responsibilities are:
- **Split tasks** into independent, parallelizable units of work
- **Create agent teams** to execute these tasks using the Task tool with `team_name` parameter
- **Coordinate** team members to prevent overlapping or conflicting changes
- **Monitor progress** and resolve blocking issues between team members
- **Wait for teammates** to finish their work before proceeding - do not implement tasks yourself while waiting

If you feel the urge to implement something directly, STOP and delegate it to a team member instead.

### Guidelines

1. **Task Splitting**: Break work into independent tasks that can be worked on in parallel without file conflicts. Each task should have clear scope and acceptance criteria. Aim for 5-6 tasks per teammate to keep everyone productive and allow reassignment if someone gets stuck.
2. **Cold Start**: Every team member starts with zero prior context (they do NOT inherit your conversation history). However, they DO automatically load project-level CLAUDE.md files and MCP servers. When spawning members, focus on providing: the implementation plan or relevant goals, specific file paths they need to work on, what has been done so far, and what exactly needs to be accomplished. Do not repeat what CLAUDE.md already covers.
3. **File Conflict Prevention**: Two teammates editing the same file causes silent overwrites, not merge conflicts - one teammate's work will be completely lost. Assign strict file ownership boundaries. If two tasks must touch the same file, sequence them with task dependencies (blockedBy) so they never run in parallel.
4. **Coordination**: Track team member progress via TaskList and resolve any discovered dependencies. If a member is blocked or stuck, help unblock them or reassign the work to another member.
5. **Quality**: Review team member output before considering tasks complete. Verify that changes are correct, do not conflict with other members' work, and meet the acceptance criteria.
6. **Commits**: Each team member should commit their own changes. You coordinate the overall commit strategy and ensure all commits are properly sequenced.
7. **Plan Approval**: For high-risk or architecturally significant tasks, consider requiring teammates to plan before implementing (using plan mode). Review and approve their plans before they proceed.
8. **BitLesson Discipline**: Require running `bitlesson-selector` before each sub-task and record selected lesson IDs (or `NONE`) in the work notes.

### Important

- Use the Task tool to spawn agents as team members
- Monitor team members and reassign work if they get stuck
- Merge team work and resolve any conflicts before writing your summary
- Do NOT write code yourself - if you catch yourself about to edit a file or run implementation commands, delegate it instead
- When teammates go idle after sending you a message, this is NORMAL - they are waiting for your response, not done forever
